# Linear-regression
 created simple linear regression  to predict the percentage of marksof students.
 Linear Regression is a linear model that assumes a linear relationship between input variables(independent variables 'x') and output variable(dependent variable-'y') such that 'y' can be calculated from a linear combination of input variables(x).
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on â€“ the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.
Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). Hence, the name is Linear Regression.
